            </div>
            <div class="wbs-body">
                <p>The Production Readiness Review (PRR) is a critical assessment for products intended for high-volume manufacturing. It evaluates whether the design, processes, and supply chain are prepared to support efficient and reliable production at scale. </p>
                <p>In the early stages, the PRR focuses on high-level manufacturing considerations— such as tooling strategy, production flow, and supplier capabilities. As the design matures, later-stage PRRs delve into detailed evaluations of manufacturing plans, process controls, quality assurance measures, and readiness of production infrastructure.</p>
                <p>This review ensures that all aspects of the production lifecycle are aligned to deliver consistent, cost-effective output while meeting performance and quality standards. </p>

                <p>The Digital Engineering initiative includes six aspects:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wbs-st-two">
                <p>1. Systems Architecture</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wbs-body">
                <p>This aspect emphasizes the blueprint for designing complex systems, ensuring all components are aligned and function cohesively. It involves defining the structure, interactions, and data flows to meet both technical requirements and business objectives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wbs-st-two">
                <p>2. Requirements Engineering</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wbs-body">
                <p>This aspect centers on the process of identifying and documenting the needs, constraints, and expectations of stakeholders. It transforms these inputs into clear, actionable specifications that guide the entire development lifecycle, ensuring alignment with both user and organizational goals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wbs-st-two">
                <p>3. Digital Twin</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wbs-body">
                <p>This aspect revolves around creating a virtual counterpart of a physical asset or system, allowing for continuous monitoring and performance optimization. It uses real-time data to simulate real-work conditions, improving decision-making, predictive maintenance, and overall system efficiency.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wbs-st-two">
                <p>4. Digital Environment</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wbs-body">
                <p>This aspect focuses on creating a virtual space that showcases the entire progression of a system project, from concept development to final vendor configuration. It serves as a comprehensive platform for visualizing and interacting with all stages of the project, enabling stakeholders to review, refine, and collaborate on every detail in a cohesive immersive environment.</p>

                <p>The AstraLux Systems Engineering Team has developed a Deliverable-Oriented Work Breakdown Structure (DO WBS) derived from an Object-Oriented Work Breakdown Structure (OO WBS). This approach focuses on the project’s results— such as Hardware Configuration Items (HWCIs), Software Configuration Items (SWCIs), systems, and software requirement specifications— placing them at the center of the planning process. The DO WBS converts these components into action deliverables that Systems Engineerings must complete in preparation for the upcoming () and integration, ensuring the components are fully realized.</p>

                <p>The DO WBS will be translated into JIRA Task Management tickets to ensure seamless execution by the system engineers. Each deliverable within the WBS will be broken down into specific, actionable tasks, which will then be assigned as individual JIRA tickets. These tickets will outline clear objectives, timelines, and dependencies, enabling the team to efficiently track progress and complete the deliverables required for a successful ().</p>
                <p>Each deliverable will be broken down into epics, stories, and tasks, where:</p>
                <p>Epics represent large, overarching goals that are broken into similar, more manageable components</p>
                <p>Stories are specific user-focused deliverables that outline a particular function or outcome within the Epic </p>
