                <p>The Work Breakdown Structure for the <i>Sidera I</i> project provides a detailed decomposition of all tasks and deliverables necessary for successful completion. By breaking the project down into smaller, manageable components, the WBS ensures that every aspect of the development process- from initial design to final testing- is clearly defined and assigned. This structured approach helps to identify dependencies between tasks, allocate resources efficiently, and monitor progress at a granular level. Each work package is linked to specific milestones, making it easier to track performance and identify any areas requiring attention. Through the WBS, stakeholders can maintain a clear overview of the project's scope, ensuring that all critical elements are addressed and that the project stays aligned with its objectives.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="wbs-body">
                <p>a. The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) evaluates the proposed system design to ensure it is technically sound, feasible, and aligned with all identified requirements. This review assesses the overall maturity of design concepts, examines underlying assumptions and engineering calculations, and presents the merits and limitations of alternative approaches. Preliminary models— such as sketches, mock-ups, or early prototypes— may be used to support the evaluation.</p>
                <p>In addition to technical adequacy, the PRD provides a comprehensive review of project status, including budget alignment, schedule progress, identified risk factors, and proposed mitigation strategies. It serves as a critical checkpoint before advancing to detailed design and development phases.</p>
